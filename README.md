# Refrigerator Simulator Application - Final Project 



Created a Refrigerator Simulator that can be transition into a mobile application. In my code design, I applied the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming such as Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inhertiance, and Encapsulation (see in Powerpoint). This application deploys the use of Interfaces, Use Cases, UML Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, State Diagrams, Design Patterns (Behavioral, Structural, Creational), Overriding, File Handling, and Unit Tests.
