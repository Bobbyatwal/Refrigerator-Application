# Refrigerator Simulator Application - Final Project 


I applied concepts of Object-Oriented Programming such as Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inhertiance, and Encapsulation (see in Powerpoint). This application deploys the use of Design Patterns (Behavioral, Structural, Creational), Interfaces, Use Cases, UML Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, State Diagrams, Overriding, File Handling, Concurrency, Serialization, and Unit Tests.
